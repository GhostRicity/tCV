This man hired me and after 50 hours of working a portfolio website for him, he decided to hire someone else for the job, while not informing the origianl developer.

This project was intresting since the user anted to implement full CMS functionality in a single page, with the ability to play music from it. This lead to some fairly complex use cases. After a month of work the client Tor, stated the following.

*«Don’t worry about it Eddy, I’ve another one on the job already. I’m not skilled enough to do these things myself, so there’s no need for me to try.«*

In this case it is not clear is the CMS to hard to use or the client just prefers WordPress. Overall a client with poor communication skills, who did not pay for the work done.
